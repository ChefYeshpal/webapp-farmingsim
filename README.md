you farm with a tractor, you buy more land, you make more money!

In this game, the user is a farmer, who got a small plot of land from their grandpapi (such a rare story...) and have to farm with a tractor. They can buy neighbouring lands after achieving a certain amount and as the farm land is arranged in a grid like pattern, I think this would come into the theme of "grid" for this week?

## Stuff I wanna add

- [ ] Farm land
- [ ] A tractor
    - Should be controllable via wasd or arrow keys
    - Should be upgradable?
- [ ] Some seasons?
- [ ] Ability to buy neighbouring land
    - Considering the game container would be divided into 9 parts, and user has initially only 1 part
- [ ] Seasonal crop variation
    - if they plant the wrong crop in the wrong season then crop can fail
    - Check how to do this though...
- [ ] Music & Sounds
    - Background music
    - Tractor noises
    - Crop cropping noises
- [ ] Some kinda animation difference from harvested crop vs growing crop
    - Growing crop should go from green to slight yellow
    - Harvesting crop should leave darker patches of yellow in harvested area
    - Re-tilling the soil would leave dirl colour
    - Then the user has to re-plant new seeds
